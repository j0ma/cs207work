The trick is seeing whether the naive recursive algorithm computes the same subproblems over and over and over again. If so, storing the answer for each subproblems in a table to look up instead of recompute can lead to an efficient algorithm. Start with a recursive algorithm or definition. Only once we have a correct recursive algorithm do we worry about speeding it up by using a results matrix. Dynamic programming is generally the right method for optimization problems on combinatorial objects that have an inherent left to right order among components. Left-to-right objects includes: character strings, rooted trees, polygons, and integer sequences."

    "**Worst case:** list completely unsorted\n",
    "On the first iteration of the for-loop, the inner loop doesn't execute at all, on the second one, the inner loop executes once, and so on until we get to $i = n - 1$, where the while-loop executes $n-2$ times. Overall, this corresponds to $0 + 1 + 2 + ... + n - 2 = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 2 = O(n^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best case:** list completely sorted\n",
    "In this case, the inner while loop does not execute at all, so the procedure only executes the outer for loop for values $i = 1, i = 2, ..., i = n-1$. This implies $O(n)$ operations.\n",

    "Let's assume a completely randomly sorted array. The probability that the relative ordering of two elements is wrong (i.e. that they form an inversion) is 0.5. There are $\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ pairs of elements, so the expected number of inversions is \n",
    "$$\\sum_{j=1}^{\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}}{0.5} = \\frac{n(n-1)}{4} = \\Theta(n^2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in insertion sort, the outer loop always performs $\\Theta(n)$ work, and the inner loop simply reverses all inversions. Thus, the total work is $\\Theta(n + \\frac{n(n-1)}{4}) = \\Theta({n^2})$."
